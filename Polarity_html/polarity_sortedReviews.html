<h1>16: <em><span style="color: green">+.342</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Way too much money for a phone of any type!!</mark></p>

<h1>22: <em><span style="color: green">+.249</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Everyone reading this is probably familiar with the Apple phone line up so I am going to focus on the differences between the iPhone X and iPhone 7 plus specifically.</mark> <mark class = "pos">First off, the set-up process has been significantly streamlined.</mark> <mark class = "pos">When setting up your new iPhone X setup will ask you if your old iPhone is nearby, select yes, and you can wireless transfer all your apps, settings, backgrounds, passwords, etc. to your new phone in a few clicks.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I really appreciated this streamlined process and it was incredibly quick and easy to transfer all my settings to my new iPhone X.The other main features that have been upgraded are as follows:New screen (5.8” OLED is the most vibrant and clear screen ever produced by Apple)- Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaining a larger screen size than the iPhone 7/8 Plus.</mark> <mark class = "pos">(See comparison images attached of the iPhone X versus iPhone 7 Plus).- OLED Screen offers deeper blacks and brighter whites resulting in greater color reproduction.- Similar to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus the iPhone X uses true tone technology to mimic the lighting conditions around it and adjust the white balance accordingly.- The notch cut out of the top of the screen is where Apple has included the face recognition sensors, front camera, and a host of other sensors.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I thought this would be annoying but Apple has cleverly used the screen real estate on both sides to include the time, date, battery indicators, etc.Farewell Touch-ID, Hello Face-ID- Face-ID is Apples new facial recognition technology which has replaced the finger printer reader and home button in order to free up additional screen real-estate.</mark> <mark class = "pos">This is new and only available on the iPhone X.- Apples facial recognition is light years ahead of Samsung or any other carrier.</mark> I have tested this flawlessly with glasses, a hat, and even in the dark. <mark class = "pos">It is as simple as looking at your phone and swiping up from the bottom.- I was worried this feature would be inconsistent or frustrating but it has worked really well.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The only time it is a bit more inconvenient is if the phone is sitting on your desk or a flat surface you kind of have to lean over a bit or angle the phone towards you to unlock it.- This super powerful new camera also enables the animoji features which maps your facial expressions to create a talking emoji.</mark> <mark class = "pos">This is a fun feature but more a novelty than anything.- This same true-depth camera makes the iPhone X the ultimate phone for taking selfies.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The new portrait mode allows the user blur the background, or even cut yourself out entirely and place yourself on a black background.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Additional noteworthy features and changes:- The rear camera boasts a dual 12MP sensor array with improved aperture and wide angle lens with image stabilization.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The increased aperture from 2.8 to 2.4 allows for better images in low light conditions.- Video capabilities have also approved as well to include 60p 4k video recording delivering clear, fluid images.- Increased audio quality and volume- Increased RAM size to 3GB and new Bionic Chip makes the iPhone X one of the most powerful smartphones are the market.- Updated design features glass back and sides which make the phone beautiful looking.</mark> <mark class = "pos">A very welcome change in the normal design.- Battery life: The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus.</mark> <mark class = "pos">A full charge from 0-100% takes about 2 hours and 10 minutes in my testing.- In addition, wireless charging has finally been added to the new iPhone X, and 8 series phones.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have not tested this out but am excited to give it a try (Wireless charging pad is not included with the phone).</mark> <mark class = "neg">Bottom line, the iPhone X is another smash hit from Apple.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Every feature people were concerned about turned out to work flawlessly as usual.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have only had the iPhone for about 24 hours so it is early to leave a long-term focused review but so far the new iPhone X has lived up to the hype.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The iPhone X may not revolutionize the smart phone industry but it is a welcome upgrade to the iPhone which designs were getting a bit dated.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I am excited about Apples new strategy to release a flagship model and allow the new features to trickle down to next generation’s phones.</mark> <mark class = "pos">If you have the money to spare you won’t likely be disappointed.</mark> <mark class = "pos">My only complaint is the phone only comes in 64GB or 256GB basically forcing users to pay an extra $150 to get decent storage.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Further, the beautiful glass back on the screen feels fantastic and has a great weight to it.</mark> However, a replacement screen will cost you $275+ and the back glass replacement is rumored to cost around $400. Essentially a single drop could result in a $700 repair bill. <mark class = "neg">Unfortunately this means most phones will be shielded in a case and will not be enjoyed.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Read less***Note Carrier Compatibility:All carrier variant iPhone X in the world are carrier unlocked.</mark> The one thing will need to note is your current network. There are a number of different iphone variants in the USA such as AT&T, T-mobile, Sprint, and Verizon. <mark class = "neg">A Sim-free version is not available yet.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Here is a compatibility breakdown.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Verizon Phone: Unlocked, Supports GSM and CDMA.Spring Phone: Unlocked, Supports GSM and CDMAAT&T Phone: Unlocked, Supports GSM OnlyT-mobile Phone: Unlocked, Supports GSM OnlyYou need a CDMA compatible phone if you are on Verizon or Sprint.</mark> <mark class = "pos">GSM phones work with AT&T, T-mobile, and nearly every other international network provider.</mark></p>

<h1>31: <em><span style="color: green">+.167</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">This is a cross-post review from the unlocked version, but given they are the exact same phone, I thought it would be good to post:I received my X on launch day and I absolutely love this phone.</mark> <mark class = "pos">If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down to the bullet point list.</mark> The transition:NO home button! <mark class = "pos">The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I was expecting this transition to  a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature.</mark> <mark class = "pos">For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand).</mark> <mark class = "pos">Face ID:I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications.</mark> <mark class = "pos">As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone.</mark> <mark class = "neg">By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password).</mark> <mark class = "pos">I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode.It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours.</mark> No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. <mark class = "pos">Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook).</mark> <mark class = "neg">The price:There seems to be this running idea that a $1,000 phone is a crazy purchase, but I would have to disagree.</mark> Why? <mark class = "pos">My logic is as followed: Phone's are one of the most used devices (easily mine) so for starters, I would like a nice one.</mark> If I didn't buy the device in full, I would have been paying roughly $2/ a day on a contract with Verizon. <mark class = "pos">The base model is a 64GB iPhone loaded with the best Apple has to offer.</mark> <mark class = "neg">A 128GB 6S at launch was $850.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Yes, there's a price difference, but my point is that it's not as gigantic as it may seem.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I personally would advocate a 64GB version and utilizing cloud storage if you need more space, but do note, this is Apple's flagship and there are cheaper iPhone's out there.</mark> <mark class = "pos">What I love:- The screen looks amazing.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black).- The Notch!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Yes, the notch.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere.</mark> It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it.- The screen size. <mark class = "pos">I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands.</mark> That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. <mark class = "pos">The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store.- I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing.</mark> <mark class = "pos">As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth.- Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way.- The camera takes wonderful pictures.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera.- The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Great for impromptu music listening.- The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">What I don't:Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.</mark></p>

<h1>35: <em><span style="color: green">+.149</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I upgraded from the iPhone 6+ to the X at full price through AT&T.</mark> It took nearly 6 weeks to receive. It is significantly small than the iPhone 6 plus by size. <mark class = "pos">The actual screen dimensions is about the same.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Yes, the color is somewhat brighter but the clarity and brightness is not (even with adjustments).</mark> <mark class = "pos">Simple to set up and outside of no home button (swipe up), it is essentially the same layout.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I would agree with other reviewers, it is no faster than the older model.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The camera does produce a nicer photo but is this device worth $1300 for a better camera?</mark> I do not think so. <mark class = "pos">You could purchase an even nicer camera for less.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Facial recognition is fair to good but far from perfect.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I ended up switching to digital security since I use the phone for work.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I need as close to absolute security as possible.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Speaker sound is better in volume and clarity.</mark> <mark class = "pos">As you go from screen to screen (different applications), you can literally feel the phone shake like one use to feel hard drives activate in older laptops.</mark> I do not know what is up with this since in all my previous iPhones I never felt any mechanical movement from the phone itself. <mark class = "neg">Everything works appropriately but this brief vibration is more annoying to me than the absence of the home button and being able to turn the phone off my pressing one button instead of two.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Bad workmanship to engineering.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Bottom line: if you do not absolutely have to upgrade your phone or you are not receiving the phone free (AT&T is giving a free iPhone 8 with an added line), then I would wait for the next generation.</mark> <mark class = "pos">A larger phone is anticipated with the "X" features but I must admit I find the "X" is under-featured when it comes to being a pivotal new generation of iPhones.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The iPhone X is anything but pivotal, ground breaking (outside of dropping it, it will indeed break) or full of new useful features you do not already have on your current iPhone.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Even if I had to upgrade I would go with the iPhone 8 plus over the "X" since you keep the home button and larger size is nice for jacket pocket and those with bigger hands.</mark> <mark class = "neg">To say I am disappointed in the iPhone X is an understatement.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have monitors which are more impressive than this phone's screen and cost a third of this phone.</mark> <mark class = "neg">In my world, I have already abandoned the Apple laptops and iMacs for my workplace and home for similar unimpressive advancements in technology.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I am now going to do the same with my phones as well.</mark> Will try Samsung and other models for the future. <mark class = "neg">Apple is loosing their magic touch since the loss of Steve Jobs.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Some individuals do indeed make a company great.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I have little doubt Jobs would have been very unhappy with this iPhone and would never have released it but made the company wait 6-12 months to have something truly better than the status quo.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Otherwise it is my conviction this model was put out to make money and all of us fools who fell for this are now truly paying the price.</mark> This is a turning point for me with Apple. I am done with their products. <mark class = "pos">I am done with iTunes (music).</mark> "Alexa, never order any more Apple products for me! <mark class = "pos">And please play current hits and call my office."</mark></p>
<h1>36: <em><span style="color: green">+.141</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I think people need to comprehend if they are reviewing the price OR THE PEFORMANCE OF THE PHONE.</mark> <mark class = "pos">You can’t give a crappy review because you don’t like the price.</mark> <mark class = "pos">As for me I’m pretty much bleh towards the phone.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Have had it almost a week and I guess it was worth 1000.</mark> <mark class = "neg">If it disappeared tomorrow and I had to go back to my 6s plus, don’t think I would bat an eye.</mark> But I cannot say that it is full of bugs and issues. Does take some getting used to on no home button but have not had any problems with mine. Would also suggest the lifeproof next case. <mark class = "neg">Otterbox was junk in terms of how the side buttons would respond.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Lifeproof slam doesn’t cover the charging port and really doesn’t have much water repelleing properties (yes I know the X aready has water resistant properties).</mark> <mark class = "pos">Life proof next covers all ports and really works greatwith the side buttons.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Plus clear back shows the exterior of the phone nicely.</mark></p>

<h1>42: <em><span style="color: green">+.030</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Unlike the iPhone 8 Plus, here the camera module has sharp edges and is positioned vertically. <mark class = "neg">When the device is on the table, on the back, it actually always lies on the camera module and if you press the housing, it starts walking on a flat surface.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The dimensions of the device are such that it is wide and quite noticeably cuts into the hand.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The back panel is made of tempered glass, as well as the front panel covering the screen with oleophobic coating, but the marks from the hands are clearly visible.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The glass panel behind is needed for wireless charging.</mark> On the left side there is a lever, which includes a noiseless mode, below - two volume keys. <mark class = "pos">On the right side, the on / off button (in fact, it's now unlocking and calling Siri), just below - the tray for the nanoSIM card.</mark> <mark class = "pos">At the bottom of the right is the speaker, the second speaker is on the front panel above the screen.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They work in pairs, and the volume of the sound is different, for this parameter iPhone X can give odds to many flagships, and I like it in this aspect.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The microphone is on the bottom end, and also at the camera block behind.</mark> At the top end, the microphone was not placed. <mark class = "neg">The noise reduction system works medium, in noisy conditions your interlocutor hears strange sounds.</mark> Places for the percentage of battery power on the display just do not. In iPhone X, the battery charge is very quickly consumed during voice calls, which is not typical for such devices. Unlike a fingerprint, you can register only one person. <mark class = "neg">No way to share the phone with biometrics, only a password that can be passed on to someone.</mark> <mark class = "pos">In practice, face recognition is quickly adjusted.</mark> <mark class = "pos">When driving the iPhone X, the phone holder will have to be strongly shifted to the left to the handlebar, and also tilt it towards the face, otherwise no recognition occurs.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I really like how the device records video (especially 4K at a rate of 60 frames per second), but this video can only be viewed on the device itself, since a new compression format is used, when transmitting all video is converted.</mark> In the maximum resolution mode, the sound is written to one microphone. <mark class = "neg">In iPhone X changed the interface and it will take a little time to get used to the lack of the "Home" key.</mark></p>

<h1>45: <em><span style="color: green">+.013</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">There’s no reason to hate on a newly released phone that is the same price as buying it directly from Apple.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I think these phones are awesome.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Of course, I don’t have the money or an issue with my current phone, so I can’t buy it now, but rest assured I would.</mark></p>
