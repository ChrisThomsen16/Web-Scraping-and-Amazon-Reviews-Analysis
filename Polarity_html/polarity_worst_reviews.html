<h1>2: <em><span style="color: red">-.111</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I have had the x for sometime now. <mark class = "neg">I can say that of all the iphones, the x is my biggest disappointment.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I do not always get text messages, my reminders may or may not notify me, I can no longer send a text with the special effects, etc.</mark> <mark class = "neg">This morning my alarm sounded for maybe two seconds and then just shut off.</mark> I have been told to bring it back due to it being a hardware issue. Now, I get that these things may happen on occasion but the fact that close to 50% of people that I know that did splurge for the x are having issues. <mark class = "pos">Some, including my husband, are opting not to make a swap because they don't really care about the special effects???</mark> It's more than that. <mark class = "neg">I feel this product was prematurely released and I not happy.</mark> The not having a home button is an adjustment, can't say I'm a fan. <mark class = "neg">The face recognition is awful.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I feel that it is a HUGE safety concern.</mark> <mark class = "neg">If someone grabs your phone, be it your child in school and whether it be horsing around or not, they grab the phone and unlock it with your face and run off.</mark> <mark class = "neg">A young mom, walking with a stroller and small toddler in tow, gets mugged, a shopper distracted on their phone and a thug steels it.</mark> <mark class = "neg">These are all legit concerns.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Yes, you can opt to not use it, which my family has done.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I am truly disappointed.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I called Apple customer care and was told that they have received many calls like mine.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The x by far being the most complaints with hardware issues.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Save your money and get the 8 or maybe try another brand but do not waste your money on the x.</mark></p>
